## Key points
- Unit tests help ensure your code works as expected during initial development and that regressions are not introduced down the road.
- You should organize your code to separate the business logic you will unit test from the presentation logic you will UI test. MVVM is a very suitable pattern for this purpose.
- It helps to organize your test code using a pattern such as Given-When-Then.
- You can use expectations to test time-based asynchronous Combine code.
- Itâ€™s important to test both for positive as well as negative conditions.
