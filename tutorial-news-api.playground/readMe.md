## Key points
- Foundation includes several publishers that mirror counterpart methods in the Swift standard library and you can even use them interchangeably as you did with reduce in this chapter.
- Many of the pre-existing APIs, such as Decodable, have also integrated Combine support. This lets you use one standard approach across all of your code.
- By composing a chain of Combine operators, you can perform fairly complex operations in a streamlined and easy-to-follow way â€” especially compared to pre-Combine APIs!
