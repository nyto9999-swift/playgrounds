# Tutorial combine api swiftui 

## Key points
- With SwiftUI, your UI is a function of your state. You cause your UI to render itself by committing changes to the data declared as the viewâ€™s state, among other view dependencies. You learned various ways to manage state in SwiftUI:

- Use @State to add local state to a view and @ObservedObject to add a dependency on an external ObservableObject in your Combine code.
- Use onReceive view modifier to subscribe an external publisher directly.
- Use @Environment to add a dependency to one of the system-provided environment settings and @EnvironmentObject for your own custom environment objects.
