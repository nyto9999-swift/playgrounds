## Key points

- Combine’s handling of asynchronous events extends to manipulating time itself.
- Even though it doesn’t provide time-traveling options, the framework has operators that let you abstract work over long periods of time, rather than just handling discrete events.
- Time can be shifted using the delay operator.
- You can manage the flow of values over time like a dam and release them by chunks using collect.
- Picking individual values over time is easy with debounce and throttle.
- Not letting time run out is the job of timeout.
- Time can be measured with measureInterval.
